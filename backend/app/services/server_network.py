"""The addresses this server answers on.

Reading them needs no privileges - `ip addr show` is a read-only netlink query
any user may make - so this goes straight to the command rather than through
the sudo helper.

Only global addresses are reported: loopback and link-local are real addresses
but nothing outside the machine can reach them, so listing them on the settings
page would only invite somebody to hand one to a customer.
