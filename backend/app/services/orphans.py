"""What a deleted website leaves behind, and clearing it.

Deleting a site through the panel cleans up after itself. This exists for
everything that predates those fixes, plus the cases the panel never sees: a
site removed by hand, an import that failed halfway, a domain a customer moved
to another server. On one live server this was four Let's Encrypt lineages,
seven vhost backups, two uploaded certificates and six panel SNI copies - and
the first of those is the one that hurts, because a renewal config for a site
nobody hosts wakes certbot twice a day and eventually fails for good.

The panel decides what is live; the helper does the privileged inspection and
removal, keeps its own guards, and copies everything into /root/snpanel-removed
before deleting.
