"""Start the panel.

uvicorn's command line takes exactly one certificate. The panel needs one per
hostname, so the server is built here instead: the same configuration the
command line would have produced, plus the SNI callback that answers each
handshake with the certificate for the name the browser asked for.

Everything is read from the environment, which systemd fills from
/opt/snpanel/backend/.env:

    PANEL_PORT        port to listen on (default 2222)
    PANEL_SSL_CERT    default certificate, used for hostnames without one
    PANEL_SSL_KEY     its private key
    PANEL_SNI_DIR     where the helper keeps the per-hostname certificates
